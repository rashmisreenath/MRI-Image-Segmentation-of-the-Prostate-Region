# Prostate Image Segmentation using AI on Image Data

Prostate cancer disease is one of the common types that cause men's prostate damage all over the world. The patient undergoes  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before any medications are prescribed to the patient and in the process the images so scanned are wider spread out, and it becomes very important to segment only the prostate regions which plays a crucial role in many diagnostic medical applications. Automatic segmentation of prostate and prostate zones from MR images makes many diagnostic and therapeutic applications easier and efficient.

## Dataset

The Train and Test datasets were created using different the combinations of images, including T2-Weighted (T2W) images, Diffusion-Weighted Images (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) images. To merge and aligne the DWI, ADC and T2W images.
